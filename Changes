    sec are all '00'. However, a reminder that you should be using the
    DateTime modules instead.

2009-08-19 09:23  rbowen

    * No functional changes in this revision, just a move to svn and a
    cleanup of the documentation, removing references to long-defunct
    URLs, and adding references to the datetime.perl.org project, where
    you really should be looking for all of your Perl datetime needs.

2003-01-18 15:11  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.10): Added license to manifest

2003-01-18 15:10  rbowen

	* LICENSE (1.1): Put LICENSE in the distribution, since we had
	never made it clear what license we were distributing under.

2003-01-18 15:09  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.72): Patch received from Martijn, to make
	days_this_year run faster.

2003-01-13 07:23  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.71), t/08offset.t (1.10): Make
	_offset_(from|to)_seconds into offset_(from|to)_seconds. ie. make
	them public functions, rather than hidden ones, since they are
	useful from more places than just inside the module. Requested by
	Martijn.

2003-01-10 15:57  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.20): Had this patch for a long time. Requires a
	particular verion of prereq's for functionality that we are using.

2002-08-31 22:46  rbowen

	* t/: 02normalize.t (1.4), 03components.t (1.3), 04epoch.t (1.3),
	05ical.t (1.2), 06add.t (1.7), 07compare.t (1.2): Change a bunch of
	tests from ok() to is() in order that 'make test' will report more
	useful things on failure.

2002-08-31 22:37  rbowen

	* t/01sanity.t (1.7): Moved from ok() tests to is() tests, in order
	to get more useful failure messages.

2002-06-26 17:21  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.70): Documentation bug. new() does not in
	fact accept a 'tz' argument.

2002-02-07 06:33  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.61, Date-ICal-1_69): Bumping up the
	version number on Duration.pm so that CPAN reports useful
	information about what the latest version is.

2002-02-07 06:32  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.69), t/08offset.t (1.9) (utags:
	Date-ICal-1_69): Remove skip in test, and actually test the
	localtime functionality.  Adjust seconds the correct direction in
	the ical method.

2002-01-21 14:44  jesse

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.68): Date::ICal->new bitched if you were
	setting an epoch time and had even an offset of "0". That's not
	useful to anyone. it now explicitly checks to make sure an offset
	isn't 0 before bitching.

2001-12-27 21:15  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.67), t/12add.t (1.1, Date-ICal-1_69): We are
	now able to use + and += to add durations (either a string or a
	Date::ICal::Duration object) to a Date::ICal object. Added tests
	for same.

2001-12-26 21:37  rbowen

	* t/: 09greg.t (1.2), 10subtract.t (1.5) (utags: Date-ICal-1_69):
	Spacing changes (courtesy of perltidy) in the tests, so that I can
	better read what is going on here. No functional change.

2001-12-26 21:27  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.19, Date-ICal-1_69): Add a vim syntax highlighting
	line to the Change log file so that it looks pretty.

2001-12-26 21:25  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.66): No longer need to do strange workaround
	to subtract dates resulting in negative duration. It Just Works
	(tm).

2001-12-26 21:07  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.10), t/11duration.t (1.5,
	Date-ICal-1_69): Permit the creation of Duration objects with
	negative attributes. Note that all attributes have to have the same
	sign. Mixed-sign attributes will result in the entire duration
	being negative. This could stand to be documented more clearly. 
	Also, all accessors have been modified to explicitly return undef
	if that attribute has zero value. I'm not sure if this is desired,
	but it's the way that it is documented, and what the tests expect. 
	Tests added to verify all this stuff.

2001-12-26 20:21  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.18): Add the Duration documentation to the README
	on make dist

2001-12-26 20:15  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.9): Code folds. No functional
	change.

2001-12-26 15:55  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.65), t/10subtract.t (1.4): A small
	work-around because D::I::Duration does not correctly handle
	negative arguments yet. See diff 1.7 -> 1.8 of
	Date::ICal::Duration.  When D::I::Duration correctly handles
	negative arguments, this patch should be mostly reversed.  Added
	tests for subtracting dates to get negative duration.

2001-12-26 15:50  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.8): This is step one. Components now
	return signed. And the 'sign' argument is being honored now, rather
	than being discarded. Need to add tests for this stuff. Still does
	not correctly handle negative arguments.

2001-12-20 16:04  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.64), t/10subtract.t (1.3): Added the ability
	to subtract durations from a date, either as a Date::ICal::Duration
	object, or as a ICal duration string. Tests to match.

2001-12-20 10:20  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.7): Documentation: The parameter is
	'ical' not 'string' to create an object with an ical duration
	string.

2001-12-19 07:52  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.17), README (1.4): As suggested, generatel README
	at release time, rather than having it in CVS.

2001-12-18 21:24  rbowen

	* README (1.3), lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.63): Bring README up to date
	with the POD. Minor POD fix in ICal.pm

2001-12-18 21:21  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.62): Patch from Yitzchak. Adds day_of_week
	method. Other minor POD fixes.

2001-12-16 19:21  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.9, Date-ICal-1_69, Date-ICal-1_61): Added
	t/11duration.t to MANIFEST

2001-12-16 19:06  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.16, Date-ICal-1_61): Added warning back in about
	possibly changing API.

2001-12-16 17:15  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.15), lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.61, Date-ICal-1_61),
	t/10subtract.t (1.2, Date-ICal-1_61): sub subtract in Date::ICal
	now uses Date::ICal::Duration objects, rather than doing its own
	math. Added tests to test this functionality, and some TODO notes
	for what I would like it to do in the near future.

2001-12-16 17:14  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.6, Date-ICal-1_61): Added sub
	as_days to return the number of days without weeks %'ed out.  And
	some code folding foo.

2001-12-16 16:54  coral

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.5): Extracting clarity from
	Duration.pm's synopsis is HARD.

2001-12-16 16:52  rbowen

	* t/11duration.t (1.4, Date-ICal-1_61): Removes some redundant 'my'
	in tests.

2001-12-16 16:30  coral

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.4): TODO: Figure out what we're
	going to do with sign data.

2001-12-16 16:12  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.3): Added code for accesors and
	as_elements.

2001-12-16 16:11  srl

	* t/11duration.t (1.3): Added tests for as_elements and for
	accessors.  Added a new sign() read-only accessor.

2001-12-16 15:47  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.2): Fleshed out some more of the
	methods; this is largely drawn from Net::ICal::Duration, which I
	expect to be replaced by this module.

2001-12-16 15:45  srl

	* t/11duration.t (1.2): Added more tests for Duration
	functionality.

2001-12-16 15:14  rbowen

	* Changes (1.3), Makefile.PL (1.14): Take Changes out of cvs.
	Autogenerate it on make dist.

2001-12-16 15:11  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.8): Add Changes to the manifest so that it gets
	shipped with the dist.

2001-12-14 21:24  rbowen

	* Changes (1.2): Updated change log to include the entire project,
	using cvs2cl

2001-12-14 00:29  rbowen

	* INTERNALS (1.2, Date-ICal-1_69, Date-ICal-1_61): Remove
	inaccurate and/or outdates notes about the internals. Once the
	internals stabilize, I'll write something more useful here.

2001-12-14 00:27  rbowen

	* Changes (1.1): Starter Changes file. Jesse said something about
	generating a Changes file from CVS, which is what this is. Perhaps
	his is a little more pleasant looking

2001-12-14 00:01  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.60): Primarily documentation updates.

2001-12-14 00:01  rbowen

	* README (1.2, Date-ICal-1_61): Bring README up to date with the
	module.

2001-12-13 22:20  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.7), lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.59), t/06add.t (1.6,
	Date-ICal-1_69, Date-ICal-1_61): Patch submitted by Yitzchak to
	make add() DWIMier, to permit more reliable subtraction of dates
	via the add() method, and tests to make sure that it is all doing
	what it should. Also provides the eom_mode parameter to make adding
	months do what you expect ALL THE TIME. All tests still pass. 
	Yitzchak++

2001-12-13 17:33  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal/Duration.pm (1.1), t/11duration.t (1.1): Added
	Date::ICal::Duration trivial skeleton and basic tests. API comments
	welcome; code coming soon.

2001-12-12 21:58  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.58), t/10subtract.t (1.1): Possible
	implementation of subtraction of dates. Comments welcomed.

2001-12-12 19:25  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.6), Makefile.PL (1.13): ICal.pm has (finally!) moved
	into lib/Date where it should have been to begin with.

2001-12-11 10:12  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.57): I've removed some warnings, because we
	are basically warning when people use documented default behavior.
	This is very irritating. I also need to update the documentation so
	that it is more clear on this point, but for the moment, this
	scratches my immediate itch. --DrBacchus

2001-12-08 22:30  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.12): Memoize no longer a prereq

2001-11-30 22:25  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.56): This is, I believe, the intent of
	Yitzchak's first two patches. There is no content in this diff,
	just style things. Ran perltidy on it to make the whole file
	conform to agreed-upon style standards. And standardized the usage
	of code folding characters.

2001-11-30 12:02  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.11): Need Test::More to support skip().

2001-11-27 21:00  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.55), t/06add.t (1.5): Able to add n years to
	a date via the add method. Tests to match.

2001-11-26 09:38  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.5): Most of the tests are not making it into the
	distribution, because the MANIFEST never got updated.

2001-11-24 13:57  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.54): Oops. I reversed the order of the
	argument list when I added this function back in, thereby breaking
	all code that was calling it.

2001-11-24 11:25  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.53): Since _seconds_from_offset returns a
	number, not a string, we only need the sign if it is negative.
	Resolves some test failures that I was seeing in t/08offset.t for
	negative offsets.

2001-11-23 22:42  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.52): Resolves one of the test failures in
	offset/add - when add crossed a day boundary by virtue of a
	difference in seconds, it was not compenting in the day value, and
	could end up with negative times.

2001-11-23 22:15  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.10): There is no longer a module called
	Pod::Tests. It is now called Test::Inline.

2001-11-23 22:11  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.51): Added back in days_this_year method
	using new greg2jd method.

2001-11-23 22:03  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.9): There are no embedded tests at this time, so
	this is generating bogus test failures. Uncomment if you add inline
	tests back in.

2001-11-23 21:54  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.50), t/09greg.t (1.1, Date-ICal-1_61): This
	is Yitzchak's patch to give us much more efficient gregorian <->
	julian conversions, and to remove strange anomolous problems in the
	17th and 18 centuries. Note that we lose a few internal methods
	here, at least one of which I'll be putting back in a minute.

2001-11-22 05:56  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.49), t/08offset.t (1.8, Date-ICal-1_61): This
	version incorporates a patch by Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes to adjust
	the offset() API. It no longer takes integer seconds as a
	parameter, because there's no programmatic way to tell the
	difference between, say, +3600 (UTC+1 in seconds) and +3600
	(UTC+36, if you interpret that as an HHMM value).
	
	I also refactored things a bit, creating an _offset_from_seconds
	method to match _offset_to_seconds; this should eliminate some
	duplication. There's also new POD to clear up some confusion about
	new(offset => foo) used together with offset().

2001-11-22 04:22  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.48): API-consistency patch from Yitzchak
	Scott-Thoennes <sthoenna@efn.org>; Makes the ical() method take a
	hash of parameters, not a hashref, so that ical() is like the other
	methods. This crept in around 1.44, and it shouldn't have. My
	mistake.

2001-11-22 04:02  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.47): Fixed some 5.6isms; patch contributed by
	Yitzchak Scott-Thoennes <sthoenna@efn.org>.

2001-11-15 08:25  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.46), t/08offset.t (1.7): Minor patches to
	tests; another piece of optimization from Mike Heins.

2001-11-15 00:32  srl

	* benchmark.pl (1.1, Date-ICal-1_69, Date-ICal-1_61),
	lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.45), t/08offset.t (1.6): Added benchmark.pl to
	help developers in optimizing the module.  Also modified new() to
	warn more clearly if the $TZ environment variable isn't set, and
	not to utterly fail tests if $TZ isn't there.

2001-11-15 00:11  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.44), t/08offset.t (1.5): Further patches from
	Mike Heins, plus some documentation from me:	    - added
	localtime argument to ical() for output in localtime.	  Added
	documentation about the localtime argument. Note	    that
	$ENV{$TZ} is now relevant to some of the module's behavior.    -
	removed a memoize() that wasn't providing significant speed    
	improvements.	      - minor optimization of _calc_local_offset

2001-11-14 23:20  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.43): Committed another small patch by Mike
	Heins, which precalculates the values returned by the months()
	function so that the module is faster at runtime.

2001-11-14 23:11  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.42): Another patch from Mike Heins
	(mheins@minivend.com); an optimizing cheat for leapyears; uses a
	precalculated table of values instead of always calculating
	leapyear values. I edited Mike's patch slightly so that @leapcheat
	isn't a package global.

2001-11-14 22:58  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.41): Incorporated part of a patch by Mike
	Heins (mheins@minivend.com); an optimization. Internal storage of
	julian times is now in $self->{julian} and $self->{julsec}, instead
	of using an array.  This gives us slightly better speed. Also, made
	some of the UTC behaviors slightly more consistent.

2001-10-16 06:33  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.40), t/01sanity.t (1.6, Date-ICal-1_69,
	Date-ICal-1_61), t/02normalize.t (1.3, Date-ICal-1_69,
	Date-ICal-1_61), t/03components.t (1.2, Date-ICal-1_69,
	Date-ICal-1_61), t/04epoch.t (1.2, Date-ICal-1_69, Date-ICal-1_61),
	t/06add.t (1.4), t/08offset.t (1.4): Further fixes to the offset()
	method. This code isn't as well-tested as I'd like it to be, but it
	seems to do the right thing for all the tests that are there. I had
	to revise many of the tests, because the API semantics have
	changed. Times must now be explicitly specified with a Z in order
	to be handled as UTC.

2001-10-14 21:58  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.4): Rename Readme to README, per request of coral

2001-10-14 21:56  rbowen

	* README (1.1), Readme (1.3): coral says README is prefered to
	Readme, wrt CPAN. I had no opinions either way, so here it is.

2001-10-09 22:58  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.39), t/08offset.t (1.3): Added some tests,
	reorganized some code to prepare spaces for offset/timezone-aware
	output. Added at least one test that's known to fail for purposes
	of knowing when we succeed. :)

2001-10-09 00:28  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.38), t/08offset.t (1.2): Started working on
	code to properly handle times with offsets from GMT.  added a new
	_calc_local_offset method to figure out what the current machine's
	UTC offset is. We need tests for this that will work in any
	timezone; patches welcome.

2001-09-30 09:19  lotr

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.37): * Oops, forgot some bits when I added
	month to add() * use overload for compare

2001-09-29 07:01  lotr

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.36): Add the ability to add months to a date.
	Needed for Net::ICal::Recurrence

2001-09-26 11:26  lotr

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.35), t/06add.t (1.3): * fix off-by-one error
	in months() and add tests for that

2001-09-11 23:26  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.34): There's no particular reason to have
	Date::ICal be 5.6 dependant.

2001-08-25 08:20  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.33), t/06add.t (1.2): Fixed bug reported by
	Chris Jones. In sub add, I was checking one attribute and using
	another. Added tests for this bug, and for adding durations by
	attribute.

2001-08-09 23:27  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.32), t/08offset.t (1.1): Started adding
	timezone support by making an offset() method and an offset
	property. This still needs to be wired into the new() method and
	the output methods, but we have to resolve some interface details
	first.

2001-08-06 22:41  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.31): Test::More gets angry if there are no
	tests.

2001-08-06 22:30  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.30): Moved the inline tests into t/ for the
	sake of making the module more readable. Please don't let this
	discorage you from writing inline tests.

2001-08-06 22:25  rbowen

	* t/: 04epoch.t (1.1), 05ical.t (1.1, Date-ICal-1_69,
	Date-ICal-1_61), 06add.t (1.1), 07compare.t (1.1, Date-ICal-1_69,
	Date-ICal-1_61): Moved a lot of tests out of the module into .t
	files.

2001-08-06 15:32  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.8), lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.29): Creating an object
	without args was calling gmtime( $args{epoch} ).  Fixed and added
	tests. Also added Time::HiRes to PREREQ list.

2001-08-06 14:45  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.28): sub epoch was referencing another sub
	that has gone away. Fixed, and added tests.

2001-08-02 00:38  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.27): Adjusted the add() method to return a
	copy of $self instead of the return value of $self->jd(). This was
	important to making the Net::ICal tests pass, but it's also the
	Right Way, I think.

2001-08-01 23:47  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.26): Handle negative durations correctly.

2001-07-31 22:19  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.25): Two main changes here.  1) Split the
	internal date/time representation into date, time integers, so that
	we don't have any more roundoff error.	2) Memoized the parsetime
	and parsedate methods, so that we're not doing that three times
	every time we want three components, which we were doing.

2001-07-31 22:17  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.7): Added Memoize, Storable to prereq list, so
	that I can memoize some functions.

2001-07-31 07:43  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.24): Create a new D::I object using another
	D::I object (or subclass) as the initial value. This allows for
	immediate conversion of a date from one calendar format to another,
	which was one of my main goals to start with. :-)

2001-07-27 12:24  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.23), t/03components.t (1.1): Creating objects
	from components was not working. Fixed.

2001-07-26 14:36  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.3), lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.22): Removed unused internal
	methods.  Updated ToDo list.

2001-07-26 14:14  rbowen

	* INTERNALS (1.1): Discussion of the internals, and the limitations
	thereof.

2001-07-26 11:49  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.21): To compare two dates, just need to
	compare their mjd representation.

2001-07-26 11:21  rbowen

	* Readme (1.2): Generated from POD

2001-07-26 11:19  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.2): Added Readme

2001-07-25 21:32  srl

	* Makefile.PL (1.6): Added a requirement for Time::Local to the
	Makefile.PL.

2001-07-25 21:04  srl

	* Makefile.PL (1.5): Did a release tag on Date-ICal-1_20, since
	DrBacchus forgot to; then added a line for Date::Leapyear in the
	PREREQ section of Makefile.PL.

2001-07-25 19:31  rbowen

	* t/: 01sanity.t (1.5), 02normalize.t (1.2) (utags:
	Date-ICal-1_20): Updated tests for changes to ICal. Removed some
	that are no longer relevant. "fixed" some due to round-off error.
	This all works, for some slightly relaxed definition of "works".
	After releasing, we need to be a little more rigorous.

2001-07-25 19:29  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.20, Date-ICal-1_20): Complete rewrite.
	Internals all changed. More discussion on the mailing list.

2001-07-23 23:21  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.19): Added a minor fix to Date::ICal to allow
	accessors to be set to 0.

2001-07-23 22:28  rbowen

	* Readme (1.1, Date-ICal-1_20): Readme generated from POD

2001-07-23 21:54  srl

	* Makefile.PL (1.4, Date-ICal-1_20), lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.18)
	(utags: date-ical-1_18_01): Minor spelling corrections. Also, added
	a note about the future Julian rework to TODO, and a note about
	failing tests in Makefile.PL.

2001-07-08 01:17  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.17): Added some arithmetic-verification tests
	to Date::ICal--- they all fail currently. The problems are related
	to addition when the parameter is a duration string--- unit
	rollover seems to be breaking, and second values seem to be
	particularly off.

2001-07-07 22:24  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.16): Should not attempt to calculate an epoch
	time for dates outside of the epoch. Added tests also.

2001-07-07 18:20  rbowen

	* Makefile.PL (1.3): Pod::Tests and Test::More are prereq's for
	this module.

2001-07-07 15:44  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.15): ICal is now the only authoritative
	internal format, as far as I can tell. There are still some parts
	of this that confuse me, but epoch is being recalculated from ICal
	when it is requested. We need to make sure that if epoch is called
	for dates outside of the epoch, that we warn. That is not being
	done yet. But all tests currently pass. At least for me. There are
	probably some timezone dependencies still, and I'd appreciate some
	tests by folks in other timezones. However, I did not comment out
	any tests in order to make it pass the tests. In fact, I added
	several.

2001-07-07 15:25  rbowen

	* t/01sanity.t (1.4, date-ical-1_18_01): It helps if you are
	actually testing the right object.

2001-07-07 00:10  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.7), t/01sanity.t (1.3): Adjusted some tests
	in Date::ICal to use == in tests instead of eq.
	
	Tried to adjust some mistakes in Date::ICal's 01sanity.t so that
	those tests will pass, but no luck. Dates before the epoch are
	still failing.

2001-07-06 13:05  rbowen

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.6): Calling accessor methods rather than hash
	keys. Certain attributes get calculated the first time you call the
	method, rather than being calculated up front, in case you never
	actually need it. All Pod::Tests now succeed.

2001-07-05 22:37  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.5): Added a bunch of tests for some error
	conditions in Date::ICal.
	
	In particular, we need to check out the results of the accessors,
	and we need to decide whether they're supposed to return numbers
	with leading zeroes.

2001-07-03 23:33  rbowen

	* t/00load.t (1.2, Date-ICal-1_69, Date-ICal-1_61, Date-ICal-1_20,
	date-ical-1_18_01): Moved to Test::More for added readability

2001-07-03 23:33  rbowen

	* t/01sanity.t (1.2): Moved the test to Test::More. Uncommented
	several failing tests, so that I have some motivation to fix the
	problem. Ran perltidy. I know, it's a fetish ...

2001-07-02 22:55  srl

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.4): Committed a bunch of tests for Date::ICal
	that are failing; I don't have a solution, but I wanted to share
	this in hopes someone can help.

2001-06-29 14:07  lotr

	* lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.3): _epoch_from_ical:    fix to change month
	and year to be in the format timegm expects in	  the DATE-TIME
	case, just like the DATE case already had

2001-06-27 22:22  srl

	* Makefile.PL (1.2), lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.2): Implemented the
	compare() function (with tests) for Date::ICal.
	
	Added a section in the Makefile.PL to compile the embedded tests
	into a t/ file.
	
	Corrected some of the podtests that were already in D::I, because
	pod2test didn't like them.

2001-06-27 20:53  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.1.1.1, Date-ICal-1_20, date-ical-1_18_01),
	Makefile.PL (1.1.1.1), lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.1.1.1), t/00load.t
	(1.1.1.1), t/01sanity.t (1.1.1.1), t/02normalize.t (1.1.1.1,
	date-ical-1_18_01) (utags: Date-ICal-1_14): Moving Date::ICal to
	sourceforge reefknot repository. I hope I don't regret this.

2001-06-27 20:53  rbowen

	* MANIFEST (1.1), Makefile.PL (1.1), lib/Date/ICal.pm (1.1),
	t/00load.t (1.1), t/01sanity.t (1.1), t/02normalize.t (1.1):
